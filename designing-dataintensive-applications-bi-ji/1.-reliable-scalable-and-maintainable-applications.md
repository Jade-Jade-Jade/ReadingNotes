# 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

这一章主要介绍了搭建一个Data System应该考虑的三个方面。这不仅仅局限于Data System, 也应该是每个系统设计中我们应该考虑到的。

## Reliable
- "Continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong".
- Design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failure
### Hardware Faults
- 增加可替换的冗余组件: Add redundancy to the individual hardware components in order to reduce the failure rate of the system. Disak may be set up in a RAID configuartion, servers may have dual power supplies and hot-swappable CPUs, and datacenters may have battteries and diesel generators for backup power.
- Multi-machine redundancy was only required by a small number of applications for which high availability was absolutely essential.

### Software Errors
一般来说，很多机器同时出现因为硬件原因而导致的故障的概率是不大的。然而软件上的Bug却会造成这样的后果。比如说
- Bad input
- Use up shared resource - CPU usage, memory, disk space or network bandwith
- Dependeny slow down/unresponsive
- Cascading failures

关于Bug, 文中有个表达我很喜欢，摘录于下:
"The bugs that cause these kinds of software faults often lies dormant for a long time until they are triggered by an unusual set of circumstances. In thoses circumstances, it revealed that the software is making some kind of assumption about its environment - and while that assumption is usually true, it eventually stops being true for some reason"

### Human Errors
不做过多说明了。

## Scalable
虽然当前系统是Realiable的，但这并不意味着未来也是如此。Scalbility is the term we use to describe a system's ability to cope with increased load.
这一章提到了High percentiles of response time (tail latencies)以及为何有时候很重要。比如P99.9 Latency，拿aws来说，虽然这个只影响每千分之一的用户。但是这千分之一往往是最重要的用户。

### Scaling up and Scaling out
- [过去比较流行的做法]Scaling up: vertical scaling, moving to a more powerful machine
- [目前更常见的用法]Scaling out: horizontal scaling. distrubting the load across multiple small machines.

## Maintainable
文中提及了三点
- **Operability**: make it easy for operations team to keep the system runing smoothly
- **Simplicity**: make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible from the system
- **Evolvability**: make it easy for engineers to make changes
